        <h2>Support for the Gamma Corrector App</h2>
        <p>Gamma Corrector is a simple app used to get gamma corrected RGB values for inputting into your LED controller that doesn't support automatic gamma correction.</p>
        <h3>Using the app</h3>
        <p>Use the color selector to select a color. The app will display two sets of RGB values. The values of the color you selected, and a set of values that have had a gamma curve applied to them.</p>
        <p>You can change the applied gamma using the gamma value selection. Values between 2.2 and 3.0 tend to have the best results. Feel free to experiment.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>When using the app, for example, let's say you want this color:</p>
        <p><img src="images/app_screen.jpg" alt="image of the application screen using a brownish color" /></p>
        <p>If you input the values 170,124,40 into your trimlight app, it would show that color, but on the LEDs it would look more like:</p>
        <p><img src="images/cat_uncorrected.jpg" alt="image of pixels with a very bright color"/></p>
        <p>If instead you input the values 82,33,1, as suggested by Gamma Corrector, in the app it would look like a very dark brown, but on your LEDs it would look more like your original color:</p>
        <p><img src="images/cat_corrected.jpg" alt="image of pixels with a more true-to-life color" /></p>
        <p>Note, due to the way our eyes work, the difference is much more pronounced in person. Cameras don't fully capture the same range that we see.</p>

        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>If you need support with the app, you can contact me at the email address below, but a better place to get support would be the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/trimlight">"Trimlight Community"</a> group on Facebook.</p>
